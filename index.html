      <section id="challenges">
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>One of the primary challenges faced during the development of the 3D Maze Game was implementing the raycasting algorithm. This algorithm was crucial for rendering the 3D environment in real-time, creating the illusion of depth and perspective. It required a deep understanding of mathematics, trigonometry, and graphics programming. Overcoming this challenge involved persistent exploration, careful experimentation, and a relentless pursuit of perfection to deliver a visually stunning and immersive gaming experience.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="risks">
        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>A technical risk associated with the 3D Maze Game was the performance optimization of the raycasting algorithm. Rendering a complex 3D environment in real-time can be computationally intensive, potentially impacting the game's performance on lower-end hardware. To mitigate this risk, the code was optimized for efficiency and thoroughly tested on a variety of hardware configurations to ensure smooth gameplay across different devices.</p>
        <p>Another risk was the potential for limited user adoption due to the game's compatibility with the Linux kernel only. As the game was specifically designed for the Linux platform, there may be limitations in reaching a wider audience who prefer other operating systems. However, this focused approach allows for optimized performance and specific Linux-based features that enhance the gaming experience for users within that ecosystem.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="infrastructure">
        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The development process followed a structured approach using version control systems like Git and GitHub. This allowed for effective collaboration and easy tracking of code changes, ensuring a streamlined development workflow.</p>
        <p>As the 3D Maze Game is designed to run exclusively on the Linux kernel, the infrastructure revolves around supporting and optimizing its performance on Linux-based systems. Compatibility testing was conducted across various Linux distributions to ensure seamless gameplay across different environments.</p>
        <p>Testing was conducted rigorously to ensure the game's stability and compatibility within the Linux ecosystem. Extensive testing was performed on different hardware configurations and Linux distributions to identify and resolve any potential issues, guaranteeing a smooth gaming experience for Linux users.</p>
